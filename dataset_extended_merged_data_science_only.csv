What are the advantages and disadvantages of bag of words?,"Advantages:
1. Simple to understand and implement.

Disadvantages:
1. The vocabulary requires careful design, most specifically in order to manage the size, which impacts the sparsity of the document representations.
2. Sparse representations are harder to model both for computational reasons (space and time complexity) and also for information reasons
3. Discarding word order ignores the context, and in turn meaning of words in the document. Context and meaning can offer a lot to the model, that if modeled could tell the difference between the same words differently arranged (“this is interesting” vs “is this interesting”), synonyms (“old bike” vs “used bike”).",intermediate,text classification

What methods for solving linear regression do you know?,"To solve linear regression, you need to find the coefficients <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=eta""> which minimize the sum of squared errors.

Matrix Algebra method: Let's say you have `X`, a matrix of features, and `y`, a vector with the values you want to predict. After going through the matrix algebra and minimization problem, you get this solution: <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=eta = (X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y"">. 

But solving this requires you to find an inverse, which can be time-consuming, if not impossible. Luckily, there are methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR Decomposition that can reliably calculate this part <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}""> (called the pseudo-inverse) without actually needing to find an inverse.

Why do we need one-hot encoding?,"If we simply encode categorical variables with a Label encoder, they become ordinal which can lead to undesirable consequences. In this case, linear models will treat category with id 4 as twice better than a category with id 2. One-hot encoding allows us to represent a categorical variable in a numerical vector space which ensures that vectors of each category have equal distances between each other. This approach is not suited for all situations, because by using it with categorical variables of high cardinality (e.g. customer id) we will encounter problems that come into play because of the curse of dimensionality.",intermediate,classification

"What is ""curse of dimensionality""? ","The curse of dimensionality is an issue that arises when working with high-dimensional data. It is often said that ""the curse of dimensionality"" is one of the main problems with machine learning. The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that, as the number of dimensions (features) in a data set increases, the number of data points required to accurately learn the relationships between those features increases exponentially.

A simple example where we have a data set with two features, x1 and x2. If we want to learn the relationship between these two features, we need to have enough data points so that we can accurately estimate the parameters of that relationship. However, if we add a third feature, x3, then the number of data points required to accurately learn the relationships between all three features increases exponentially. This is because there are now more parameters to estimate, and the number of data points needed to accurately estimate those parameters increases exponentially with the number of parameters.

Simply put, the curse of dimensionality basically means that the error increases with the increase in the number of features.",intermediate,classification

What are the main assumptions of linear regression?,"There are several assumptions of linear regression. If any of them is violated, model predictions and interpretation may be worthless or misleading.

1. **Linear relationship** between features and target variable.
2. **Additivity** means that the effect of changes in one of the features on the target variable does not depend on values of other features. For example, a model for predicting revenue of a company have of two features - the number of items _a_ sold and the number of items _b_ sold. When company sells more items _a_ the revenue increases and this is independent of the number of items _b_ sold. But, if customers who buy _a_ stop buying _b_, the additivity assumption is violated.
3. Features are not correlated (no **collinearity**) since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear features on the target variable.
4. Errors are independently and identically normally distributed (y<sub>i</sub> = B0 + B1*x1<sub>i</sub> + ... + error<sub>i</sub>):
   1. No correlation between errors (consecutive errors in the case of time series data).
   2. Constant variance of errors - **homoscedasticity**. For example, in case of time series, seasonal patterns can increase errors in seasons with higher activity.
   3. Errors are normally distributed, otherwise some features will have more influence on the target variable than to others. If the error distribution is significantly non-normal, confidence intervals may be too wide or too narrow.",intermediate,supervised learning

It is widely used in machine learning applications.",intermediate,supervised learning
What is linear regression? When do we use it?,"Linear regression is a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (y).

```

B is regression coefficients, x values are the independent (explanatory) variables  and y is dependent variable.

The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.

Simple linear regression:

```
y = B0 + B1*x1

y = B0 + B1*x1 + ... + Bn * xN

In the usual GD, you have to run through ALL the samples in your training set in order to estimate the gradient and do a single update for a parameter in a particular iteration. In SGD, on the other hand, you use ONLY ONE or SUBSET of training sample from your training set to estimate the gradient and do the update for a parameter in a particular iteration.

* It uses the wisdom of the crowd, i.e. it gives recommendations based on the experience of others.

* Say we want to give a score that indicates how much user u will like an item i. Then we can calculate it with the experience of N other users U as r_ui = 1/N * sum(v in U) r_vi.
* In order to rate similar experiences with a higher weight, we can introduce a similarity between users that we use as a multiplier for each rating.
* Also, as users have an individual profile, one user may have an average rating much larger than another user, so we use normalization techniques (e.g. centering or Z-score normalization) to remove the users' biases.
* Collaborative filtering does only need a rating matrix as input and improves over time. However, it does not work well on sparse data, does not work for cold starts (see below) and usually tends to overfit.",intermediate,recommender systems

What is the bias-variance trade-off?,"**Bias** is the error introduced by approximating the true underlying function, which can be quite complex, by a simpler model. **Variance** is a model sensitivity to changes in the training dataset.

**Bias-variance trade-off** is a relationship between the expected test error and the variance and the bias - both contribute to the level of the test error and ideally should be as small as possible:

```
ExpectedTestError = Variance + Bias² + IrreducibleError
```

But as a model complexity increases, the bias decreases and the variance increases which leads to *overfitting*. And vice versa, model simplification helps to decrease the variance but it increases the bias which leads to *underfitting*.",beginner,supervised learning

Hence, there is no hard thumb rule in deciding the depth, but literature suggests a few tips on tuning the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting:

- limit the maximum depth of a tree
- limit the number of test nodes
- limit the minimum number of objects at a node required to split
- do not split a node when, at least, one of the resulting subsample sizes is below a given threshold
- stop developing a node if it does not sufficiently improve the fit.",intermediate,feature selection

In addition to that, each time a split in a tree is considered, random forest takes a *random sample of m features from full set of n features* (with replacement) and uses this subset of features as candidates for the split (for example, `m = sqrt(n)`).

Training decision trees on random data samples from the training dataset *reduces variance*. Sampling features for each split in a decision tree *decorrelates trees*.",intermediate,feature selection

"How we can incorporate implicit feedback (clicks, etc) into our recommender systems?","In comparison to explicit feedback, implicit feedback datasets lack negative examples. For example, explicit feedback can be a positive or a negative rating, but implicit feedback may be the number of purchases or clicks. One popular approach to solve this problem is named weighted alternating least squares (wALS) [Hu, Y., Koren, Y., & Volinsky, C. (2008, December). Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets. In Data Mining, 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on (pp. 263-272). IEEE.]. Instead of modeling the rating matrix directly, the numbers (e.g. amount of clicks) describe the strength in observations of user actions. The model tries to find latent factors that can be used to predict the expected preference of a user for an item.",intermediate,recommender systems

Adam tends to converge faster, while SGD often converges to more optimal solutions.

What are the potential problems with many large trees?,"- Overfitting: A large number of large trees can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and is able to memorize the training data but doesn't generalize well to new, unseen data.

- Slow prediction time: As the number of trees in the forest increases, the prediction time for new data points can become quite slow. This can be a problem when you need to make predictions in real-time or on a large dataset.

- Memory consumption: Random Forest models with many large trees can consume a lot of memory, which can be a problem when working with large datasets or on a limited hardware.

- Lack of interpretability: Random Forest models with many large trees can be difficult to interpret, making it harder to understand how the model is making predictions or what features are most important.

- Difficulty in tuning : With an increasing number of large trees the tuning process becomes more complex and computationally expensive.

It's important to keep in mind that the number of trees in a Random Forest should be chosen based on the specific problem and dataset, rather than using a large number of trees by default. In practice, the number of trees in a random forest is chosen based on the trade-off between the computational cost and the performance.",intermediate,feature selection

Receptive fields larger than 3 x 3 are rarely employed as too much information is lost. 

Other pooling techniques include:

* Average pooling, the output is the average value of the receptive field.

How L1 regularization looks like in a linear model?,"L1 regularization adds a penalty term to our cost function which is equal to the sum of modules of models coefficients multiplied by a lambda hyperparameter. For example, cost function with L1 regularization will look like: <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sum_{i=0}^{N}%20(y_i%20-%20\sum_{j=0}^{M}%20x_{ij}%20*%20w_j)%2B\lambda\sum_{j=0}^{M}%20\left%20|%20w_j%20

How do we interpret weights in linear models?,"Without normalizing weights or variables, if you increase the corresponding predictor by one unit, the coefficient represents on average how much the output changes. By the way, this interpretation still works for logistic regression - if you increase the corresponding predictor by one unit, the weight represents the change in the log of the odds.

If the variables are normalized, we can interpret weights in linear models like the importance of this variable in the predicted result.",intermediate,regularization

How we can initialize the weights of a neural network?,"Proper initialization of weight matrix in neural network is very necessary.
Simply we can say there are two ways for initializations.
   1. Initializing weights with zeroes.
      Setting weights to zero makes your network no better than a linear model. It is important to note that setting biases to 0 will not create any troubles as non zero weights take care of breaking the symmetry and even if bias is 0, the values in every neuron are still different.  
   2. Initializing weights randomly.
      Assigning random values to weights is better than just 0 assignment. 
* a) If weights are initialized with very high values the term np.dot(W,X)+b becomes significantly higher and if an activation function like sigmoid() is applied, the function maps its value near to 1 where the slope of gradient changes slowly and learning takes a lot of time.
* b) If weights are initialized with low values it gets mapped to 0, where the case is the same as above. This problem is often referred to as the vanishing gradient.",intermediate,neural networks

What are the decision trees?,"This is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. Surprisingly, it works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables. 

In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based on most significant attributes/ independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible.

A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure, where each internal node (non-leaf node) denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (or terminal node) holds a value for the target variable.

Various techniques : like Gini, Information Gain, Chi-square, entropy.",beginner,feature selection

What’s the normal distribution? Why do we care about it?,"The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution whose probability density function takes the following formula:

![formula](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/NormalDistribution/NumberedEquation1.gif)

where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the distribution.

The normal distribution derives its importance from the **Central Limit Theorem**, which states that if we draw a large enough number of samples, their mean will follow a normal distribution regardless of the initial distribution of the sample, i.e **the distribution of the mean of the samples is normal**. It is important that each sample is independent from the other.

This is powerful because it helps us study processes whose population distribution is unknown to us.",beginner,supervised learning

If a weight for one variable is higher than for another — can we say that this variable is more important?,"Yes - if your predictor variables are normalized.

Without normalization, the weight represents the change in the output per unit change in the predictor. If you have a predictor with a huge range and scale that is used to predict an output with a very small range - for example, using each nation's GDP to predict maternal mortality rates - your coefficient should be very small. That does not necessarily mean that this predictor variable is not important compared to the others.",intermediate,regularization

Which hyper-parameter tuning strategies (in general) do you know?,"There are several strategies for hyper-tuning but I would argue that the three most popular nowadays are the following:
* <b>Grid Search</b> is an exhaustive approach such that for each hyper-parameter, the user needs to <i>manually</i> give a list of values for the algorithm to try. After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it's easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge.

* <b>Random Search</b> is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored.

* In a completely different framework, <b>Bayesian Optimization</b> is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a ""simple"" explanation is that a much simpler/faster <i>acquisition function</i> intelligently chooses (using a <i>surrogate function</i> such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm. Using the result of the initial combination of values on the expensive/original function, the acquisition function takes the result of the expensive/original algorithm into account and uses it as its prior knowledge to again come up with another set of hyper-parameters to choose during the next iteration. This process continues either for a specified number of iterations or for a specified amount of time and similarly the combination of hyper-parameters that performs the best on the expensive/original algorithm is chosen.",intermediate,feature selection
